# Go

Clerk's [Go SDK](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go) is a wrapper over the [Clerk Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api).

## Installation

If you are using Go Modules and have a `go.mod` file in your project's root, you can import clerk-sdk-go directly.

```go
import (
    "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2"
)
```

Alternatively, you can `go get` the package explicitly.

```sh filename="terminal"
go get -u github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2
```

## Usage

For details on how to use this module, see the [Go Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2).

The library has a resource-based structure which follows the way the [Clerk Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api) resources are organized.
Each API supports specific operations, like Create or List. While operations for each resource vary, a similar pattern is applied throughout the library.

In order to start using API operations the library needs to be configured with your Clerk API secret key. Depending on your use case,
there's two ways to use the library; with or without a client.

For most use cases, the API without a client is a better choice.

On the other hand, if you need to set up multiple Clerk API keys, using clients for API operations provides more flexibility.

Let's see both approaches in detail.

### Usage without a client

If you only use one API key, you can import the packages required for the APIs you need to interact with and call functions for API operations.

```go
import (
    "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2"
    "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2/$resource$"
)

// Each operation requires a context.Context as the first argument.
ctx := context.Background()

// Set the API key
clerk.SetKey("sk_live_XXX")

// Create
resource, err := $resource$.Create(ctx, &$resource$.CreateParams{})

// Get
resource, err := $resource$.Get(ctx, id)

// Update
resource, err := $resource$.Update(ctx, id, &$resource$.UpdateParams{})

// Delete
resource, err := $resource$.Delete(ctx, id)

// List
list, err := $resource$.List(ctx, &$resource$.ListParams{})
for _, resource := range list.$Resource$s {
    // do something with the resource
}
```

### Usage with a client

If you're dealing with multiple keys, it is recommended to use a client based approach. The API packages for each
resource export a Client, which supports all the API's operations.
This way you can create as many clients as needed, each with their own API key.

```go
import (
    "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2"
    "github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go/v2/$resource$"
)

// Each operation requires a context.Context as the first argument.
ctx := context.Background()

// Initialize a client with an API key
config := &$resource$.ClientConfig{}
config.Key = "sk_live_XXX"
client := $resource$.NewClient(config)

// Create
resource, err := client.Create(ctx, &$resource$.CreateParams{})

// Get
resource, err := client.Get(ctx, id)

// Update
resource, err := client.Update(ctx, id, &$resource$.UpdateParams{})

// Delete
resource, err := client.Delete(ctx, id)

// List
list, err := client.List(ctx, &$resource$.ListParams{})
for _, resource := range list.$Resource$s {
    // do something with the resource
}
```
